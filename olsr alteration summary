Part 1 changes:
Lines 695 through to line 885 were commented out and replaced with

for (NeighborSet::const_iterator neighbor = N.begin (); neighbor != N.end (); neighbor++)
    {
      mprSet.insert (neighbor->neighborMainAddr); // Add all of N
    }

Where N is the previously constructed set of all 1-Hop neighbors to a given node/interface


Part 2 changes:
After line 885, just before the what would have been the original mprSet is 'set', we reduce it by half randomly:

int desiredSize = mprSet.size()/2;
while (mprSet.size() != desiredSize){
  MprSet::const_iterator iter = mprSet.begin();
  std::advance(iter, (rand() % mprSet.size()));
  mprSet.erase(iter);
}

Part 3 changes:
We achieve this by halving the size of the routing table (as hinted in class). This is done in much the same way
the previous part. After line 1216, we inserted the following:

int desiredSize = m_table.size()/2;
while (m_table.size() != desiredSize){
  std::map<Ipv4Address, RoutingTableEntry>::iterator iter = m_table.begin();
  std::advance(iter, (rand() % m_table.size()));
  m_table.erase(iter);
}

Part 4 changes:
Here we remove checks the links are symmetric in two places (by commenting them out):

RoutingProtocol::MprComputation line 609
RoutingProtocol::RoutingTableComputation line 922
